## Tasks Completed ✅
- Time: 15 min
- Status: Completed
- Description: Fixed React unique key warning on Reports page (AntD Table Body) by introducing stable `id` for site rows and using it as `rowKey`.
- Key Activities: Code review of `.map()` usages; identified potential duplicate `rowKey` source; implemented patch; verified other mapped elements have keys.
- Impact: Eliminates noisy React warning; improves rendering stability for Site Performance table.
- Files Modified: 
  - apps/web/src/pages/Reports.tsx

## Tasks In Progress 🔄
- None

## Notes & Insights 💡
- Warning pointed to `Body`, which commonly indicates AntD Table row key issues.
- All chart `.map()` usages already provide keys. If warnings persist, consider switching `XAxis` in Visitor Trends to a unique `fullDate` with `tickFormatter` for display.

## Tomorrow's Priorities 📋
- Monitor for any remaining key warnings in charts.
- Tackle next UI polish tasks or bugfixes as reported.
