- Tasks Completed ✅
- 2026-02-04 00:00 | done | Fix worker image build by adding PyAV system deps (pkg-config + FFmpeg dev libs). Impact: unblocks PyAV wheel build in CI. Files: apps/worker/Dockerfile
- 2026-02-04 00:00 | done | Fix API image build by pinning Python 3.11 and adding Pillow runtime/build deps. Impact: avoids source builds for pydantic_core and ensures Pillow links to zlib/jpeg/png. Files: apps/api/Dockerfile
- Tasks In Progress 🔄
- 2026-02-04 00:00 | idle | Awaiting further CI failure details or additional build fixes.
- Notes & Insights 💡
- PyAV (aiortc) requires pkg-config and FFmpeg headers on slim images; add libav* dev packages.
- Pillow source builds on slim need zlib/jpeg/png/tiff/freetype/webp/openjpeg headers.
- Pydantic-core fails on Python 3.14 due to PyO3 max support; stick to Python 3.11 as per project constraints.
- Tomorrow's Priorities 📋
- Verify CI build steps for worker on amd64/arm64 and adjust base deps if further missing libraries are reported.
