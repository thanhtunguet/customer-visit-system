- Tasks Completed ✅
  - 14:10 - Updated worker dependency pins to resolve PyAV build failure with FFmpeg 6; impact: Docker build should pull compatible wheel instead of failing source build; files: apps/worker/requirements.txt
  - 14:22 - Fixed pip resolver conflict by aligning Pydantic pins in pyproject; impact: dependency resolution no longer contradictory; files: pyproject.toml
- Tasks In Progress 🔄

- Notes & Insights 💡
  - PyAV build failed due to FFmpeg 6 API changes (channel_layout removed). Pinning av>=11 and aiortc>=1.7 aligns with FFmpeg 6.
  - Root project dependencies conflicted by pinning pydantic==2.12.3 and pydantic[email]==2.7.1 together.
- Tomorrow's Priorities 📋
  - Re-run worker image build to confirm wheels install cleanly on amd64/arm64.
  - If build still fails, consider pinning Debian ffmpeg libs to 5.x or adjusting base image.
