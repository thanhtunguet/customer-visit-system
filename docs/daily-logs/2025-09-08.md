## Tasks Completed ✅
- 10:05 — Updated continual learning plan to centralized design (status: completed)
  - Key activities: Rewrote architecture to centralized CL, added model registry/distribution, RLS policies for new tables, unified with `staff_face_images`, clarified Milvus/MinIO usage.
  - Impact: Aligns with requirement that workers only infer and fetch approved models; reduces edge complexity and compliance risk.
  - Files modified: `CONTINUAL_LEARNING.md`

## Tasks In Progress 🔄
- None

## Notes & Insights 💡
- Centralized CL simplifies security and multi-tenant RLS; assignments per tenant/site/camera enable controlled rollouts.
- Unifying verification state into `staff_face_images` prevents data duplication and drift.
- Model artifacts should be immutable in MinIO with checksum verification; registry controls pointers; workers poll via heartbeat.

## Tomorrow's Priorities 📋
- Draft migrations for registry tables and RLS.
- Specify worker heartbeat/assignment manifests and auth scopes.
- Sketch CronJob spec for offline training pipeline and metrics.
