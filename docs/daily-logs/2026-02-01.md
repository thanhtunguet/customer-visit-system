  - Key activities: Read README, REPORT_PROGRESS, ARCHITECTURE_MIGRATION, STAFF_FACE_MANAGEMENT_ENHANCEMENT, ANALYSIS_UPDATED, and recent daily logs.
  - Impact: Confirmed worker-centric streaming/proxy architecture and staff face management features are documented as implemented; chart data integration status verified.
  - Files modified: None
- 17:55 — Audited root-level markdown docs and collected metadata (status: completed)
  - Key activities: Listed all root *.md files, extracted headings, and captured modified/created timestamps for consolidation planning.
  - Impact: Established that most root docs share the same creation/modified timestamp, limiting timeline inference; enabled consolidation proposal into docs/.
  - Files modified: docs/daily-logs/2026-02-01.md
- 18:05 — Consolidated root markdown docs into docs/ (status: completed)
  - Key activities: Created docs index and structured subfolders; merged plan and analysis notes; moved specs/architecture/presentation/requirements into docs/.
  - Impact: Reduced root-level markdown clutter; established a single documentation entrypoint.
  - Files modified: AGENTS.md, docs/index.md, docs/status/analysis.md, docs/status/plan.md, docs/architecture/worker-migration.md, docs/architecture/continual-learning.md, docs/specs/system-design.md, docs/specs/staff-face-management.md, docs/status/report-progress.md, docs/presentation/outline.md, docs/requirements/initial-prompt.md, docs/setup/deployment-guide.md, docs/ai/claude.md, docs/ai/qwen.md, docs/ai/agents.md
- 18:15 — Consolidated api/worker markdown docs into docs/ (status: completed)
  - Key activities: Moved API database and face processing docs; relocated worker README and implementation summary; archived legacy socket-only worker docs with deprecation notes.
  - Impact: Removed markdown clutter from source directories and clarified current vs legacy worker architecture.
  - Files modified: docs/index.md, docs/setup/database.md, docs/specs/face-processing.md, docs/worker/README.md, docs/status/worker-implementation-summary.md, docs/architecture/legacy/worker-simplified-architecture.md, docs/architecture/legacy/worker-socket-migration.md, docs/daily-logs/2026-02-01.md

## Tasks In Progress 🔄
- Summarize current project state into project memory notes for future sessions.

## Notes & Insights 💡
- Worker-centric streaming/proxy migration is complete and documented; API delegates camera control and stream proxying to workers.
- Staff face management supports multiple images with landmarks/embeddings, plus recognition testing; frontend has dedicated gallery/testing components.
- Reports/dashboard charts use real API data; demographics endpoint was added for reports.
- Root-level markdown docs have significant overlap (AGENTS/CLAUDE/QWEN/PLAN/ANALYSIS variants) and should be consolidated into a structured docs/ tree.

## Tomorrow's Priorities 📋
- Capture a concise project memory summary of implemented architecture and recent milestones.
- Consolidate root markdown docs into docs/ with a clear index and archival of superseded notes.
